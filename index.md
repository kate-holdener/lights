       - Circuit
       - LED polarity
       - Resistors
       - Power and ground
  - Blinking an LED with Raspberry Pi (from the Quick-Start Guide)
4. Build the blinking LED project: 
  - <a href="scratch/blinkingLED.sb3" download>Download Scratch Code</a>
  - <a href="screenShots/blinkingLED.png">View Scratch Code</a>
5. Build your 2nd project: controlling an LED with a button (use the Quick-Start Guide)
  - TODO: add code to download
  - TODO: add an image showing block code
6. Discussion:
  - What skills did we use
  - What did you enjoy the most 
  - What was the most difficult part? Why was it difficult?
7. Demo of the 2nd day completed project

### Day 2

1. Demo the completed lights projects
2. Demo individual features of the lights
  - Turn on one light
  - Use different colors
  - Turn on several lights at once
  - Blink a light
3. Assemble the lights, connecting them to your Raspberry Pi

5. Download and run demo programs:
  - <a href='python/rainbowLights.py' download>Download Rainbow Lights Code</a>
  - <a href='python/randomLights.py' download>Download Random Lights Code</a>
6. Explain simple code examples (TODO: add links to code)
  - Turn on one light
  - Use different colors. <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html">RGB Color Picker</a>
  - Turn on several lights at once

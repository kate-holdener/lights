# Holiday Lights Engineering Workshop
We are excited to have you participate in this workshop, sponsored by AAUW and delivered by SLU! This page contains the workshop agenda along with links to download some code examples.

### Day 1

1. Workshop instructors introductions
2. Get your supplies and begin assembying your Raspberry Pi - pocket size computer
3. Learn about your first Raspberry Pi project - blinking an LED
  - Circuit
  - LED polarity
  - Resistors
  - Power and ground
4. Build the blinking LED project: 
  - <a href="scratch/blinkingLED.sb3 download">Download Scratch Code</a>
  - (TODO: add an image showing the block code)
5. Build your 2nd project: controlling an LED with a button
6. Discussion:
  - What skills did we use
  - What did you enjoy the most 
  - What was the most difficult part? Why was it difficult?
7. Demo of the 2nd day completed project

### Day 2

1. Demo the completed lights projects
2. Demo individual features of the lights
  - Turn on one light
  - Use different colors
  - Turn on several lights at once
  - Blink a light
3. Assemble the lights, connecting them to your Raspberry Pi
  - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ovEwY0axvya6oyfshwoi6XtHjDIgWKuZ/view?usp=sharing">Assembly Instructions</a>
  - TODO: print out instructions
4. Turn on the lights and make configuration chagnes
  - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJrOotk2LGd6SBqmLCVecB4jKPKN6_3v/view?usp=sharing">Configuration Instructions</a>
5. Download and run demo programs:
  - <a href='python/rainbowLights.py' download>Download Rainbow Lights</a>
  - <a href='python/randomLights.py' download>Random Lights</a>
6. Explain simple code examples (TODO: add links to code)
  - Turn on one light
  - Use different colors. <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html">RGB Color Picker</a>
  - Turn on several lights at once
  - Blink a light
7. Try to do these:
  - Turn on all lights red
  - Turn on all lights green
  - Alternate between red and green
8. Create your own light display using the skills you learned
9. Complete the end of workshop survey: TODO add a link
10. Disassemble your workstations and pack
